### Brief explanation

Planck's law describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a
black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature, when there is no net flow of
matter or energy between the body and its environment.

Planck's law can be written in terms of the spectral energy density. These distributions
have units of energy per volume per spectral unit:

$$
\rho (\lambda, T) = \frac{8 \pi h c}{\lambda^5 \left(e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T}} - 1\right)}
$$

where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed
of light in the medium, whether material or vacuum.

Black-body radiation is the thermal electromagnetic radiation within or surrounding a
body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment, emitted by a black body (an
idealized opaque, non-reflective body). It has a specific spectrum of wavelengths,
inversely related to intensity that depend only on the body's temperature, which is
assumed for the sake of calculations and theory to be uniform and constant.
